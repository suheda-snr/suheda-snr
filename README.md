## 🏆 Some Projects  

### 🎬 NordFlix  
NordFlix is a full-stack movie and TV streaming platform that integrates the TMDb API for global movie data and the Finnkino API for local cinema showtimes in Finland. The platform allows users to browse trending movies and series, search by title, view detailed information (ratings, genres, cast, trailers), and check real-time cinema schedules.

### 🧑‍🚀 Helios SMS  
~ Qtathon25 Finalist (Top 10 / ~200 teams).  
Helios SMS (Spacesuit Monitoring System) is a real-time telemetry monitoring application developed during Qtathon25, where our team placed in the Top 10 out of approximately 200 teams. The system simulates a spacesuit control dashboard that tracks and visualizes critical astronaut data such as oxygen levels, temperature, pressure, and system status. The application was built using Python and Qt (PySide6) for the graphical interface, with MQTT for real-time communication and data streaming. The project highlights real-time data processing, event-driven architecture, and clear data visualization in a mission-critical context.

### 🎯 X-it
X-it is a two-part escape room system consisting of a tablet check-in application and a social mobile app, supported by a backend management platform. The system enables escape room companies to manage rooms, bookings, game sessions, and player statistics while providing users with leaderboards and performance tracking. To simulate physical escape room hardware, we integrated Firebase to replicate real-time puzzle and clue triggers, allowing realistic testing without actual devices. I participated in this Erasmus+ collaboration project between Finland 🇫🇮 and the Netherlands 🇳🇱, gaining international teamwork experience and working on solutions together.

## ✨ Fun Fact  

I’m the type of person who can get so caught up in solving a coding problem that I forget to eat, drink, or even blink. But don't worry—my coffee is always there to keep me going. ☕😅
